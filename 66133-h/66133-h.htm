<a id="confession"></a>
  CONFESSION.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I think, by God!  It is no lie;<br />
  I shall go dreaming till I die!<br />
  There is no love so real to me<br />
  As the cold passion of the sea.<br />
  There is no little, wind-swept town<br />
  By harbors where the roads go down,<br />
  Or headland gray that sits and sips<br />
  The cup of ocean at its lips,<br />
  And gazes at the far-off ships&mdash;<br />
  Or tree or house or friend so real<br />
  As visions and the dreams I feel.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No&mdash;not the windy, vaultless arch<br />
  Where all the white stars flame and march,<br />
  Nor water at the river fords<br />
  Like horses mad among the swords,<br />
  Or oaks that lean from winter storms;<br />
  These only give my vision forms.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Away!  White hands, I will not take!<br />
  And kissing mouths that cry, "Awake!"<br />
  For you I have no gramercy;<br />
  So leave me by my lotus tree,<br />
  To dream and gaze into the sky<br />
  Where red suns wither up and die,<br />
  I know!  I know!  I do not lie!<br />
  I shall go dreaming till I die!<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="despair"></a>
  DESPAIR.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You who made me<br />
  With first ecstasy<br />
  When I was sown,<br />
  And lovely things at night<br />
  I will not write<br />
  And burdened moan,<br />
  While veiny labyrinths with mystery ran<br />
  Till time and blood were life<br />
  And I began&mdash;<br />
  By holier things than God,<br />
  Or any other shibboleth of man,<br />
  Dead woman wan,<br />
  By the thin, silver scream that winter morn<br />
  In the dim, shuttered room where I was born,<br />
  Be gone!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Haunt me no more, Shroud Trailer,<br />
  Go to bed.<br />
  For the swift, golden wings I owe to you<br />
  Flap in the dust like some loose, common shoe;<br />
  Stay dead, stay dead!<br />
  I fear your glimmering bust in utter air,<br />
  The transparent eyes with shadowy stare,<br />
  The sleepy, sleepy scent of flowers<br />
  And the long hands&mdash;<br />
  They fill me with despair.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Touch me no more at night.<br />
  Borrow no form for me<br />
  Of sound or sight;<br />
  For all my days are spent by cluttered streams,<br />
  Distracted by a thousand things and faces,<br />
  And all unuttered die great dreams<br />
  Among the stagnant places.<br />
  I am not what you gave your life to buy,<br />
  And God knows what I shall be by and by!<br />
  The motes of habit sift down grain by grain,<br />
  Till I am what I am in heart and brain,<br />
  So young&mdash;so old&mdash;<br />
  Death keep you, darling,<br />
  Deaf and blind and cold.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="vale"></a>
  VALE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I love the little vale between your breasts,<br />
  But yet, farewell, for that is never still;<br />
  My garden far from you will be at rest<br />
  With lakes asleep beside a brooding hill<br />
  And cedar swales in hollow valley lands<br />
  With S-like streams between the O-shaped ponds,<br />
  Where grow frail ferns with upturned Gothic hands<br />
  And prayerful fronds.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In gray half-lights 'twill be a lovely thing<br />
  By Gypsy paths to wander at hearts-ease<br />
  Near campaniles where the bell folk sing<br />
  Down terraces of rustling linden trees,<br />
  And two hills like your breasts will be in death,<br />
  When lamps will cast their shadows silently,<br />
  Will rise still blue above the yellow corn<br />
  That ripples with a sleepy mystery.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="aftermath"></a>
  AFTERMATH.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Under the placid surface of the days<br />
  So seeming clear,<br />
  Back of the habits of old ways,<br />
  A quiet fear;<br />
  The locked-up memories of war,<br />
  Our Bluebeard's room,<br />
  Where the blood creeps underneath the door.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Never will come<br />
  In streams of days that ring<br />
  Like clean coins down the merry grooves of change,<br />
  One without grief's alloy,<br />
  Struck from pure gold of joy,<br />
  Undimmed by unshed tears,<br />
  Nor is it strange.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For in the wraith-thronged brain<br />
  Are private ghosts of pain,<br />
  Aloof, like patient sick men in a crowd<br />
  With half-veiled faces and old sorrow bowed&mdash;<br />
  Ah!  The free days can never come again!<br />
  They passed with the far, rolling drums,<br />
  Died to the moan and thunder of the guns,<br />
  And the mad, glad, clear, lyric birdsong never comes.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a id="hylas"></a>
  HYLAS.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Theocritus, Idyll XIII.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Where art thou, Hylas,<br />
  Of the golden locks?<br />
  Where art thou, Argive lad,<br />
  That fed thy flocks<br />
  In wind-swept Thessaly,<br />
  Beside the sea?<br />
  Alas!  Alas! for thee,<br />
  Hylas, Alas!</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When the Pleiads rose no more<br />
  Rowed the heroes to the shore,<br />
  Much in fear of winter gales,<br />
  And they furled the wing-like sails,<br />
  Carrying up the corded bales<br />
  From the hollow, oaken Argo<br />
  Till they lightened her of cargo.<br />
  Then they beached her for the winter<br />
  Where nor rocks nor waves could splinter<br />
  There the heroes made their camp<br />
  By the whispering seashore damp,<br />
  But the mighty Heracles,<br />
  Tired of looking at the seas,<br />
  Rose and left those sounding beaches<br />
  For the upland's wind-swept reaches.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In a little beechwood gray<br />
  Hylas fed his flock that day,<br />
  Playing all alone but gayly<br />
  Where he fed his lambkins daily,<br />
  Singing to a five-stringed psalter<br />
  By a little woodland altar,<br />
  Where a shepherd's fire of oak<br />
  Made a ribbon scarf of smoke,<br />
  Curling highly, thinly, bluely,<br />
  From the faggots cut but newly.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Moving with a god-like ease,<br />
  Through the gray boles of the trees,<br />
  Hylas first spied Heracles,<br />
  Looming vast as huge Orion,<br />
  Tawny in his skin of lion;<br />
  While through interspace of leaves,<br />
  Through the network autumn weaves,<br />
  Fell bronze sunshine and bronze leaves<br />
  On the lion skin with its paws,<br />
  Dangling, fringed with crescent claws.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Softly all the flock were bleating<br />
  As he gave the lad good greeting,<br />
  Rubbing down with leaves his club,<br />
  Mighty as a chariot hub&mdash;<br />
  Hylas stood with golden locks,<br />
  Glowing mid the lichened rocks,<br />
  Laughing in the silver beeches,<br />
  White as milk and tanned like peaches.<br />
  Then the hero loved the lad,<br />
  For his beauty made him glad,<br />
  And he took him on his knees;<br />
  Tender was huge Heracles,<br />
  Telling him of strange journeys<br />
  To the far Hesperides,<br />
  Crossing oceans in a bowl,<br />
  Till he won him heart and soul.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So these two were friends forever,<br />
  Never seen apart, together<br />
  Were they all that winter weather.<br />
  And the hero taught the youth<br />
  How to shoot and tell the truth,<br />
  How to drive a furrow straight,<br />
  Plowing, plowing, very early<br />
  When the frosty grass was curly&mdash;<br />
  Taught him how to play the lyre,<br />
  Till each wire, and wire, and wire<br />
  Sang together like a choir;<br />
  And at night young Hylas crept<br />
  In the lion skin where he slept<br />
  Where the lowing oxen team<br />
  Stood beneath the smoke-browned beam,<br />
  Slept beside the hero clypt<br />
  By the giant, downy lipped.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Centuries have fled away<br />
  Since the hero came that day<br />
  To the little beechwood gray<br />
  Where young Hylas was at play;<br />
  But I shall, as poets may,<br />
  Wreathe these roses for his head,<br />
  For his beauty is not dead.<br />
  And a voice has sung to me<br />
  Like a memory of the sea,<br />
  Sung this ancient threnody,<br />
  Like an autumn melody:<br />
  "Alas!  Alas!  for thee,<br />
  Hylas, Alas!"</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  II.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When the springtime came again<br />
  And the shepherd to his spen<br />
  Led his cloudy flock again,<br />
  When the awkward lambkins bounded<br />
  While the twin pipes whistling sounded,<br />
  And old Charon from his glen<br />
  Saw below the smoke of men<br />
  Curling thinly from the trees,<br />
  Then the heroes sought the seas.<br />
  Then the Argo left the shore,<br />
  For each eager warrior thought,<br />
  When the Pleiads rose once more,<br />
  Of the golden fleece he sought.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hylas went with Heracles,<br />
  Dancing to the dancing seas,<br />
  And he stood high in the bow,<br />
  Golden by the carven prow,<br />
  Or he lay within the furls<br />
  With the sea damp on his curls.<br />
  But at home his mother wept<br />
  With her hair upon the floor,<br />
  By the hearth where he had slept,<br />
  For her woman's heart was sore,<br />
  Saying, "He is gone from me!<br />
  Gone across the sounding sea!<br />
  Ai!  Ai!  Woe is me!<br />
  Alas!  Alas! for thee,<br />
  Hylas, Alas!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With the soft, south wind to follow<br />
  All the day the sail was hollow,<br />
  While the marvelous Orpheus sang,<br />
  Till the water furrows rang&mdash;<br />
  Never man sang as he sang&mdash;<br />
  Never man has sung the same&mdash;<br />
  And the ship flew till they came<br />
  Where the olive trees are gaunt<br />
  By the winding Hellespont,<br />
  And the Cian oxen wear<br />
  Water-bright the bronze plowshare.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  On a fallow meadow hollow,<br />
  Where the Cian cattle wallow,<br />
  There they landed two by two;<br />
  They the grass and rushes strew<br />
  For their bed,<br />
  Leaves and pointed flag stocks callow,<br />
  Foot and head.<br />
  And the evening coming on,<br />
  Heracles and Telamon<br />
  Set the supper fires upleaping<br />
  And the shadows swooping, sweeping<br />
  Overhead.<br />
  Meanwhile, Hylas with a vase<br />
  Wandered inland through the haze,<br />
  Hoping there to fill his bronze,<br />
  Girt about with goat-foot fauns,<br />
  Polished.<br />
  And around and twice around it,<br />
  Where an inwrought girdle bound it,<br />
  Fled the rout of chaste Diana,<br />
  Goddess led.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Inland in a cup-shaped vale<br />
  Willow swart and galingale<br />
  Grew with swallowwort and sparsely<br />
  Maidenhair and blooming parsley,<br />
  And the shallow's level glass<br />
  Mirrored back the yellow grass<br />
  Where the swallow dipped his wings,<br />
  Making rings on rings in rings.<br />
  There a nymph dance was afoot<br />
  Where the country people put<br />
  Cloth and oaten cakes and bread<br />
  For the water spirits dread&mdash;<br />
  Two and two and in and out,<br />
  Three and two, around about,<br />
  Hands around and then they vanished,<br />
  Leaving Hylas there astonished.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But at last he stooped to dip<br />
  And the eager water slipped,<br />
  Stuttering past the metal lip,<br />
  Choking like a sunk bell rung&mdash;<br />
  Suddenly white nymph hands clung<br />
  Cold as iron around his arm<br />
  Till he cried out in alarm.<br />
  Gave a little silver cry<br />
  And the swallow skimming nigh<br />
  Darted higher in the sky,<br />
  And the echo when he spoke&mdash;<br />
  Awoke.<br />
  Now the white hands tighter cling,<br />
  Now the funneled water ring<br />
  Fills and flows till in its glass<br />
  Nods again the nodding grass.<br />
  <i>Alas!  Alas! for thee,<br />
  Hylas, Alas!</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then it was that Heracles<br />
  For sweet Hylas ill at ease,<br />
  Left the heroes by the fire,<br />
  Strung his bowstring taut as wire,<br />
  Went to look for Hylas inland<br />
  Past a little rocky headland,<br />
  Rising higher ever higher<br />
  Till he found the cup-shaped dale,<br />
  Where he called without avail,<br />
  Shouting loudly, "Hylas, Hylas,"<br />
  Echo answered back, "Alas,"<br />
  Echo answered very slowly,<br />
  Speaking sorrowfully and lowly,<br />
  When he called the lad, "Hy-<i>las</i>,"<br />
  Hollow echo said, "Alas."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And he never found him more<br />
  On the hill or by the shore,<br />
  On the upland, on the downland,<br />
  Never found him where he lay<br />
  Down among the boulders gray,<br />
  Limp among the watery rocks,<br />
  Where the lily raised its chalice<br />
  And the dread nymphs combed his locks,<br />
  Pale Nycheia, April-eyed,<br />
  And white Eunice and Malis.<br />
  For his voice came down to these<br />
  Vague as April in the trees,<br />
  Filtered through the water clear<br />
  Far and faint yet strangely near,<br />
  Very thin&mdash;<br />
  And no echo could they hear<br />
  Only ripples' silver din<br />
  And the dull splash of an otter;<br />
  Echo cannot live in water.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But that echo comes to me<br />
  Down through half eternity<br />
  Crying out, "Alas&mdash;Alas!"<br />
  For all beauty that must pass<br />

  When time breathes it is not there&mdash;<br />
  Bony hands and coffined hair!<br />
  Alas!  Alas!  Alas!<br />

<p class="poem">
  <i>Bacchus is gone</i>!<br />
  I saw him leave the shore<br />
  Upon a moonless time,<br />
  <i>And he is gone&mdash;is gone&mdash;</i><br />

  I saw the satyrs and the bacchanals&mdash;<br />

  I heard the Goat-foot whisper in the hedge,<br />
  "<i>Bacchus is dead&mdash;is dead,</i>"<br />

  No!  No!  He is not dead; he has but fled<br />

  He does but wanton by some liberal shore&mdash;<br />
  Sun kissed&mdash;<br />
  And wreathed with vine leaves as of old,<br />

  They make me think of battlefields I saw<br />
  Where butterflies with wings of sulphurous gold<br />
  Crawled on gray faces death had made obscene<br />
  That stared with stolid dolls' eyes from the mold.<br />
  They make me think of pools of wimpled slime,<br />
  Where lizards bask upon the quaking crust,<br />
  And crumbling walls where hairy spiders weave<br />
  And snakes lie coupling in the summer dust.<br />

<h3>
  The First: Youth.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Youth is a vale afire with hollyhocks,<br />
  Robbed by those greedy publicans the bees,<br />
  Where cuckoos call like fairy story clocks<br />
  And blue-jays holla in the apple trees.<br />
  No thunderheads come up with black despair<br />
  To dim its arching orchard's leafy sheen,<br />
  But clouds like ivory towers pile in air<br />
  And gothic woods stand, cloistered, cool and green.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It is a glade where earliest flowers grow,<br />
  Along the melting snowbanks in the spring,<br />
  The waxen-stemmed anemones first show,<br />
  And Madame Woodthrush preens her dainty wing.<br />
  White hyacinths like masts with flower spars<br />
  Stand in the woods and dot each bosky lawn,<br />
  Like distant sails or clusters of pale stars<br />
  Against an emerald sky at early dawn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Cleft in life's hills, Youth is a sheltered swale<br />
  Where for a while we lie in indolence<br />
  And watch time's waterfall thin as a veil<br />
  That falls and hangs and smokes in long suspense,<br />
  And there a fountain spouts of purest joy<br />
  That feeds the fall, birds whistle on its brim,<br />
  Often I lay beside it when a boy<br />
  And saw the future mirrored vague and dim&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Heaven was there a strangely clouded page,<br />
  Two rivers on the plains met like a "Y,"<br />

  The Second: High Tide o' Life.<br />

<p class="poem">
  High Tide o' Life's a city by the sea,<br />
  By tide rips where the flood comes shouting in,<br />
  On straits that bring up ships with spicèd freights<br />
  And sails as scarlet as a woman's sin.<br />
  A mart where merchants chaffer on the docks<br />
  For pearls and feather work and jewel'd shoon,<br />
  And hurry off to feast when all the clocks<br />
  Strike anvil-tongued a thousand-noted noon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  High Tide o' Life's a city proudly vain,<br />
  With minarets from whence men can descry,<br />
  Like domes of giants' houses, chain on chain,<br />
  Death's arid mountains arabesque the sky.<br />
  And hoary uplands wave with tasseled corn,<br />
  And long sun pencils strike the hills, afar,<br />
  The walled towns smolder in the fire of morn<br />
  Like embers of a sullen, fallen star.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  High Tide o' Life's an upland where no breath<br />
  Of frost has ever crept across the grass,<br />
  But days as idle as a shibboleth<br />
  Like golden coins are quickly spent.  They pass<br />
  In hidden valleys fit for secret lust,<br />
  Where strange winged-sins like griffin-hippogryphs<br />
  Bask with their glittering scales in white-hot dust<br />
  Along a sunstruck face of basalt cliffs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It is an isle in red, witch-haunted seas<br />
  Where lovers' nights, the jade-faced moon stands still,<br />
  Pouring an amber twilight through the trees,<br />
  Across the copper ocean and the hill.<br />
  High Tide o' Life's a plain laid easterly<br />
  In realms ruled over by some fabled <i>Djinn</i><br />
  Where rivers blue as <i>lapis-lazuli</i><br />
  Rush down to meet the flood tides roaring in.<br />

  Old age is like a bleak plateau,<br />
  About&mdash;around&mdash;the dead leaves blow<br />

  Below.<br />
  In long gray lines the dead leaves go,<br />

  Left any more to come and share<br />
  The shelter from the ghost wolves' patter,<br />
  The helter-skelter, bony clatter<br />
  The helter-skelter<br />
  And the scatter<br />
  Of riven, driven souls that chatter<br />
  Beneath the cliffs, while in and out<br />

  To where Death sits, an idiot,<br />
  That stirs all things into a pot,<br />
  That stirs<br />
  Till everything is nought<br />

  Beside eternities midriff,<br />
  Where time is bordered by a cliff,<br />
  With creaking bones and dismal whoop<br />
  He makes God's bitter charnel soup&mdash;<br />

<p class="poem">
  The king has built a hermitage of bells<br />
  Beyond the city walls upon a hill,<br />
  Save when the bells are ringing for the king,<br />
  His garden by the sea is forest still,<br />
  Set on a cape curved like a hunter's horn,<br />
  Rock terraced like the temples of Cathay,<br />
  It overlooks the town and fields of corn<br />
  And glimpses topsail-ships at break of day.<br />
  And there a deep spring flows called <i>Blanchefontaine</i><br />
  That sings a deathlike monody of rest,<br />
  All night the sick moon totters on its alban waters&mdash;<br />
  It drips a sound like summer rain,<br />
  When the sun opens up his eye,<br />
  Until he stares like Cyclops from the west.<br />
  It slips through oak groves with an easy motion,<br />
  Twinkling like starlight from its shady source,<br />
  Three times it curves before it meets the ocean<br />
  Across the tide rip hoarse.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
 Like the bells in the garden, the water speaks of peace and sleep.
</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Farther up<br />
  The oak groves end abrupt,<br />
  But down that narrow valley<br />
  Like a darkened alley,<br />
  The water falls and calls<br />
  And seeps and leaps<br />
  And speaks by waterfalls;<br />
  Till the wanderer believes<br />
  There are voices in the leaves,<br />
  Whispering like thirsty lips,<br />
  Calling like muffled bells from misty ships,<br />
  Gurgling like pigeons from the eaves&mdash;<br />
  It is a demon din<br />
  Of subterranean voices old and thin,<br />
  An elfin carillon the water rings<br />
  As it sweeps on.<br />
  Halfway in that night<br />
  Of oak twilight,<br />
  Where the stream dashes down a verge,<br />
  The sound of ocean and of river merge.<br />
  And it is strange to see<br />
  The leaves whirl eerily,<br />
  When like an icy kiss,<br />
  Comes the long withering hiss<br />
  Of the tormented sea.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
 The world, knowing only itself, thinks the king is mad or bewitched to leave it and the love of the queen for solitude.

<p class="poem">
  The king is melancholy mad, I guess,<br />
  To dwell in such a dim and rustling place,<br />
  Perhaps he has a sin beyond redress,<br />
  Perhaps he sees him visions of a face.<br />
  Some say it is a bell<br />
  Has lured him to the garden by a spell,<br />
  And that the spell is holy;<br />
  Holy or not, it's melancholy!<br />
  For when the queen rides to him from the town,<br />
  With two maids posting, one on either side,<br />
  Her face is veiled with black when she rides down&mdash;<br />
  Like mourners by a hearse her two maids ride&mdash;<br />
  Her face is veiled with black,<br />
  The reins hang slack;<br />
  Some say she weeps,<br />
  But who can tell?<br />
  Why should the queen weep when she hears a bell?<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
 The queen, desiring the love of her lord above all things, calls him from his garden, but is mocked by the voice of the solitude.

<p class="poem">
  She stops by the gate blind-walled;<br />
  <i>Mary</i>!  What called?<br />
  Did something die?<br />
  What answered back?<br />
  Did the queen shriek behind her veil of black?<br />
  Something said, "O," "O," "O"<br />
  With the voice of the queen's own woe!<br />
  Was it demon or echo?<br />
  It had an "O"-shaped mouth<br />
  And a voice like the wind in the south.<br />
  It mocked her like a child,<br />
  Each time less loud<br />
  And much more mild.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The king, I guess, has lost his wits;<br />
  It must be so!<br />
  All day he sits<br />
  Where mast-straight poplars grow,<br />
  Four here, four there, foursquare,<br />
  Like columns in a row,<br />
  Still as the shadow on a mountain,<br />
  And in the middle is a fountain,<br />
  Held by two marble boys,<br />
  Whence the water falls with a sleepy noise.<br />
  It is a madman's choice<br />
  To listen to that fountain's voice.<br />
  It must be so!<br />

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
 In his garden he finds a peace like death in life.
</span>

<p class="poem">
  For never comes to that enchanted place<br />
  A sound but of the water, sea, and bells;<br />
  The shadows lie like tattered lace.<br />
  One mood is fixed there and forever,<br />
  Like a look on a dead man's face,<br />
  Like a week of summer weather,<br />
  I would that I might lay my head on such a bed,<br />
  Where dreams make spells&mdash;<br />

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
 In his youth the king heard a hermit's bell and in the ineffable peace of its sound realized the deepest longing of his heart.
</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Once in his youth,<br />
  While his new ears could yet distinguish truth,<br />
  He heard a listless bell clang langorously,<br />
  A liquid, languid clamor,<br />
  The talking tone of iron struck by the hammer,<br />
  A sound that blew like smoke across the sea,<br />
  Low, slow and trembling dreamfully<br />
  From the high, horn-shaped cape;<br />
  For there a hermit lived<br />
  And tended the wild grape,<br />
  Where white, campaniform, small lilies teem,<br />
  And there he died beside his cell,<br />
  Lost in his dream of heaven and of hell;<br />
  And the bell was the voice of that old dream.<br />
  One Lusitanian summer, long ago,<br />
  Upon a hot and azure afternoon,<br />
  While the oars trailed<br />
  And with the tide they sailed,<br />
  And tenor zithers an ivory tune&mdash;<br />
  Along cerulean coasts,<br />
  With islands like blue ghosts,<br />
  Rang the lone hermit's bell,<br />
  "<i>Alone-lin-lang-alone</i>,"<br />
  Clear as a wounded angel's voice,<br />
  Soft as a death spell that old women croon&mdash;<br />
  The harbor gulf lay placid,<br />
  And in the west there hung a half a moon.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
 Through all his life the bell never ceases to lure him. Weak from wounds, he sees a vision of the peace of death in life in the hermit's garden on the cape.
</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Never again in laughter or in tears,<br />
  Or in titantic days of crashing shields,<br />
  In triumphs with blue light upon the spears,<br />
  Or when he rivaled God upon his throne<br />
  Never had the bell's voice died;<br />
  In all his purple, blood-bought pride<br />
  It seemed to toll for him an overtone,<br />
  After the battle with his veins' blood spent,<br />
  Disheartened by the metal light of day,<br />
  Between the crisscross threads that made his tent,<br />
  The fear of life came on him as he lay;<br />
  "Outside the world is garish," thought the king,<br />
  And then&mdash;and then he heard the lone bell ring<br />
  And saw the peace and green light of a wood;<br />
  It was a very vision of escape,<br />
  A high-walled garden on the crescent cape,<br />
  Fair as an evil thing but good.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The cape is luniform<br />
  Whereon the hermit's form<br />
  Lies bony white and still<br />
  Beside the chapel on the hill;<br />
  The long grass waves as if he breathes<br />
  At every breeze that weaves;<br />
  The birds have nests among old votive wreaths<br />
  And there the snake sheds in the rustling leaves.<br />
  There are faint flower sounds<br />
  Around, for spider hands have rung<br />
  The lily with its yellow clapper tongue,<br />
  All day the mists take shape<br />
  And the high hawks slant drifting down the cape&mdash;<br />
  By night the heavenly hunter leads his hounds,<br />
  Wandering the zodiacal bounds,<br />
  And all the white stars march,<br />
  Flaming in the unalterable arch,<br />
  While the wind swings the listless bell<br />
  That rings the hermit's knell&mdash;<br />

 By his art the king casts four new bells that blend in perfect harmony with the hermit's. When they ring together the five bells charm all the senses.

  Three years the king has dwelt within a cell<br />
  That he might dream his garden first to build it well,<br />

  A frozen sound clear as a cold, deep well.<br />
  The king is melancholy mad, I guess.<br />
  At nights<br />
  The tower windows flash with lights<br />
  And many an artisan<br />
  Comes after midnight with the garden's plan<br />
  Of walls and towers<br />
  And terraces and flowers,<br />
  And spreads them wondering upon the floor;<br />
  The queen comes seldom now and least<br />
  Of all the priest;<br />
  There is no priest alive<br />
  That can the king's soul shrive;<br />
  The dead hermit from his cell<br />
  Has lured him close to heaven with his bell,<br />
  A strange, a mad, a melancholy spell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The master of campanology<br />
  Has cast four lovely voices for the king,<br />
  Four godlike metal throats that sing<br />
  In towers at the corners of the wall;<br />

  Four miracles of tone,<br />
  Of sound that flows to nothingness<br />
  Like water lines upon a river stone.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Gracious as a good gift given freely,<br />
  Comes from each campanile<br />

  And call and call the king<br />
  With the voice of the old spell<br />
  That they inherit from the hermit's bell&mdash;<br />
  Five times as strong,&mdash;<br />
  The king must go ere long&mdash;<br />
  He has the key to the garden gates,<br />
  He only waits<br />
  In courtesy to say the queen farewell.<br />

  Withering for miles around<br />
  And then is still&mdash;<br />
  All but one bell that dins on from the hill,<br />
  That strikes to ten,<br />
  While all the peasants pray<br />
  And cross themselves and say,<br />
  "Christ pity us!<br />
  It is the mad king's angelus,<br />
  Amen."<br />

  Spring's Pilgrimage.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When Spring is born of Winter<br />
  Then there comes a day<br />
  In early April with the warmth of May,<br />
  The clouds go gadding and the winds turn mild,<br />
  And Spring is born in sunlight,<br />
  Merry child!<br />
  Her nurse is April with the misty eyes;<br />
  The birds sing round her cradle<br />
  Where she lies<br />
  In green-streaked woodlands by the mantled ponds,<br />
  Where the young ferns unfurl their snaky fronds.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She comes up from the South<br />
  With a bird whistle on her pouting mouth,<br />
  And sits upon some hill<br />
  Her mother, Winter, has kept cold and still,<br />
  Till her Sun-lover melts the snow&mdash;<br />
  Then out the strong floods go.<br />
  Leaping like horses to the sea,<br />
  And the green frogs go mad with glee.<br />
  Ah!  When that child is on her way<br />
  The trees make ready, in the North<br />
  The robins herald her<br />
  And the buds put forth.<br />
  Puss Willow's little catkins are a-stir,<br />
  And it is all, is all for her!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But for a little while<br />
  She lingers in the South.<br />
  Wandering the moss-draped aisle,<br />
  Brushing the shiest flowers with her mouth.<br />
  Tuning her swanny throat<br />
  To the lush warble of the swamp-bird's note,<br />
  Beneath the lamp-hung jasmine's vine tent<br />
  Her warm, delicious childhood soon is spent.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then forth she fares,<br />
  About the middle of the month of May,<br />
  A young girl, wild-eyed, gay;<br />
  The mountains are her stairs,<br />
  The birds her harbingers,<br />
  With merry song<br />
  The peewit pipes her as she trips along&mdash;<br />
  The trumpet flowers blow fanfares.<br />
  Even the sea caves know her<br />
  And deep down<br />
  The mermen chime the bells<br />
  In some dim town,<br />
  Where wrecks lie rotten and forgotten;<br />
  The shark's fin glides<br />
  More avidly among the sea-isle tides&mdash;<br />
  The whole glad earth<br />
  Hails her with gales of mirth.<br />
  The frantic midges dance;<br />
  There is tumultuous lowing from the cattle.<br />
  When Spring fares northward from the South,<br />
  The young sun hungers for her cherry mouth<br />
  And the black stallions scream as if in battle.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now come the Dog Days<br />
  When the fat-faced sun<br />
  Like Falstaff pours hot jest<br />
  On Prince and thieves;<br />
  The earth at morning smokes<br />
  And at high noon<br />
  Straight downward point the listless hanging leaves.<br />

<p class="poem">

<p class="poem">
  Come to that elfin place<br />
  Where fawns feed on the tender grass<br />
  And slim, shy shepherds come<br />
  To see their sunburnt face<br />
  Upon a water glass,<br />
  Miraculously still&mdash;<br />
  Ah!  Magic pool!  They let the lead-sheep's bell<br />
  Grow fainter, fainter down the winding dell,<br />
  Until the only tone<br />
  That comes is the far "<i>lina-lina-lone</i>"<br />
  Of strayed sheep wandering on a windy hill.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Come, love, come, come away with me;<br />
  Drink from the coldest spring,<br />

  If dalliance and sweet kisses sped the hours.<br />

  The amber foam creams from the cider flagons,<br />
  Backward the shadow of the ground-hog shrinks,<br />
  The lanes creak with the laden harvest wagons,<br />
  And the fur thickens on the owl-eyed lynx,<br />
  The hunter sees cold mist about the moon,<br />
  And in the bottom lands at morn,<br />
  The print of tiny, thievish, fairy hands<br />
  Where the raccoon last night went stealing corn.<br />

  DREAM FRAGMENT.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I walked last night in southern Brittany,<br />
  In deep, warm meadows where the <i>rouge-gorge</i> sang,<br />
  A land cliff-bordered, by an azure sea,<br />
  Far off, far down, the muffled buoy bells rang<br />
  In bays that stretched into a land of indolence,<br />
  It seemed the peasants, in a fit of folly,<br />
  Had fled and left me in sweet impotence<br />
  To range blue uplands, tinged with melancholy,<br />
  In amethystine pastures, smooth and lone,<br />
  Charmed by a tepid ocean's magic moan.<br />

  WHEN SHADY AVENUE WAS SHADY LANE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When Shady avenue was Shady lane,<br />
  Before the city fathers changed the name,<br />
  And cows stood switching flies beneath the trees,<br />
  And old-time gardens hummed with dusty bees,<br />
  And white ducks paddled in the summer rain;<br />
  Then everybody drove to church,<br />
  And Shady avenue was Shady lane.<br />
  We lived on Arabella street, that too<br />
  Is changed&mdash;Kentucky avenue&mdash;<br />
  And where the tollgate stood beside the spring,<br />
  The phlox and hollyhocks<br />
  Once flourished by the box<br />
  Where the gatekeeper sat with key and ring.<br />
  A wiser looking man there never was,<br />
  In contemplative mood he smoked and spat,<br />
  There by the gate he sat<br />
  In an old dog-eared hat<br />
  And listened to the yellow jackets' buzz.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All this is gone&mdash;<br />
  Gone glimmering down the ways<br />
  Of old, loved things of our lost yesterdays,<br />
  After the little tollgate by the spring.<br />
  And the gatekeeper odd<br />
  Rests in the quiet sod,<br />
  Safe in the arms of God<br />
  Where thrushes sing.<br />
  Even the spring has gone, for long ago<br />
  They walled that in,<br />
  And its dark waters flow<br />
  A sunless way along;<br />
  And no one stops to wonder where they go,<br />
  For no one hears their song.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Only a few old hearts<br />
  Of these much changed parts,<br />
  Whose time will soon run out on all the clocks,<br />
  Catching the scent of clover,<br />
  Live all the old days over<br />
  When Shady avenue was Shady lane.<br />

  Do you not see, you American people,<br />
  What the triangle means?<br />
  Mind, soul, body.<br />
  Man is to live and die<br />
  In a little metaphysical, three-roomed apartment,<br />
  Office, chapel, and kitchenette.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As I sat and listened to the words of the wise man,<br />
  I looked out of the window<br />
  And suddenly a feeling of great well-being came on me.<br />
  I saw that I was made of the same stuff as the hillside<br />
  And that tomorrow I would be flowers,<br />
  Or dance in the dust motes in the sun<br />
  And that all things are one.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then two laughing children came<br />
  And threw a stone into a fountain<br />
  And the ring widened till it was lost in the pool.<br />

  And I awoke and the wise man babbled like a fool.<br />

  THE OLD JUDGE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Around the courthouse corner from the square,<br />
  Where Poet Timrod's bust stands in the glare,<br />
  There is an ancient office shuttered tight,<br />
  With fluted pillars and the paint worn bare.<br />
  Seldom, if ever now, do passing feet<br />
  Disturb that little, cobbled <i>cul-de-sac</i><br />
  Or rouse dull echoes in the quiet street<br />
  Where time has eddied back.<br />
  Only the old judge comes,<br />
  With quivering hands and thin,<br />
  With palsied scraping at the rusty lock<br />
  And enters in.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He is the last of all the courtly men,<br />
  Those lion-hearts who knew their Montesquieu,<br />
  And fought for what he taught them, too,<br />
  The STATE was something then&mdash;<br />
  But now&mdash;but now&mdash;he seems a very ghost<br />
  That haunts the little office off the square,<br />
  A Rip Van Winkle of the place at most<br />
  At which to stare.<br />
  Only on Saturdays he goes,<br />
  And no one knows,<br />
  And enters by the dusty, blinded door,<br />
  And sits and sits<br />
  While the long sunlight streams between the slits<br />
  And the rats scurry underneath the floor.<br />
  And there he stays all afternoon;<br />
  The wagons rumble in the square,<br />
  And the cracked, plaster bust of grim Calhoun<br />
  Frowns with its classic stare.<br />
  What dreams are these, old judge, of the old days,<br />
  When cotton bales made mountains on the ways,<br />
  When clipper ships were loading at the quays&mdash;<br />
  Or statelier, courtlier times of ease<br />
  And manners without flaw,<br />
  When <i>Smythe &amp; Pringle</i>,<br />
  The name is all but weathered from the shingle,<br />
  Were the state's foremost firm at law.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Aye!  Those were times!<br />
  They leap to life among the steeple chimes,<br />
  A passion and a white tone in the bells<br />
  Flatters his sleep until he dreams of bout<br />
  And rapier thrust at law&mdash;<br />
  Of frosty marches,<br />
  Camp fires and faces of dead men,<br />
  The War,<br />
  And old Virginia's academic arches&mdash;<br />
  And he is young again!<br />
  Oh!  Life!  Oh!  Glory!<br />
  He leaps up from his seat&mdash;<br />
  Ah!  Judge, the old, old story;<br />
  The blood can scarcely creep<br />
  Back to the icy feet<br />
  As the old man startles from his sleep,<br />
  The last bell hums and then&mdash;<br />
  <i>Memento mori!</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Dream, dream, old judge,<br />
  May quiet bring you ease,<br />
  Among the Wedgwood phantoms of old Greece,<br />
  Dream while the carved lambs in the frieze<br />
  Trot to the voiceless sound<br />
  Of Pan-pipes in the Georgian mantelpiece,<br />
  Summon the forms of men you used to know;<br />
  Till dead men's footfalls creak across the floor&mdash;<br />
  Is it your partner's who once long ago<br />
  Planted the brick court with <i>rêve d'or</i>?<br />
  Ah!  He is gone now with his roses,<br />
  Gone these thirty years and more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now the new South quickens, in the square<br />
  The huge trucks thunder and the motors blare.<br />
  The park oaks droop with Spanish moss and age,<br />
  The <i>jedge</i> no longer now is <i>marss</i> but <i>boss</i>,<br />
  And all the old things suffer change and loss<br />
  But still he makes his weekly pilgrimage.<br />
  Some day, some waif will look in through the pane<br />
  And see him sitting with his gold-head cane<br />
  With wide unseeing eyes a-stare&mdash;<br />
  Then there will be an end of dreams and care,<br />
  A courtesy will pass we cannot spare,<br />
  And humor, sparkling, dry as old champagne.<br />

  BEWITCHED.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A little lad was he<br />
  Who loved a fisher maid in Brittany,<br />
  Where sands stretch flat and wide<br />
  When ebbs the tide,<br />
  Smooth as a threshing floor,<br />
  And there they played, young Véronique and Pierre,<br />
  Along the shore.<br />
  Often they used to walk<br />
  Hand fast in hand,<br />
  And laughed and kissed,<br />
  Lost in such heavenly talk<br />
  That spirits there,<br />
  Who dwelt in sunny places in the mist,<br />
  Drew very near to Véronique and Pierre,<br />
  And the shrill curlews cried,<br />
  And there were rainbow castles in the foam<br />
  Where seawites died.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Mornings, dear Véronique brought shells<br />
  And laid them on the stone beside Pierre's door,<br />
  Sea-shapes of beauty, magic as the stars,<br />
  Washed from old ocean's dragon-haunted floor,<br />
  And Pierre would dream that she was sitting there<br />
  And hoped that he would find her when he woke;<br />
  And so he did&mdash;and she would look at Pierre<br />
  And he at her&mdash;and neither of them spoke.<br />
  So passed July, whose molten hours flow,<br />
  The sun laughed hot and high,<br />
  And then they said good-bye,<br />
  For Pierre must go.<br />
  He left her standing dumbly in the lane,<br />
  Her lips a-tremble with his parting kiss,<br />
  And had her farewell gift, a twisted shell,<br />
  <i>Bewitched!  Bewitched!</i>  With melancholy spell,<br />
  For in that shell it was that little Pierre<br />
  First heard love's secret whispered thus, "De-ssspairr."<br />

  THE BLINDMAN.<br />

<p class="poem">
  A Ballad of Nogent l'Artaud.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At Nogent, on the river Marne,<br />
  I passed a burning house and barn.<br />
  I went into the public square<br />
  Where pigeons fluttered in the air<br />
  And empty windows gaped a-stare.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There crouched a blindman by the wall<br />
  A-shivering in a ragged shawl,<br />
  Who gave a hopeless parrot screech<br />
  And felt the wall with halting reach.<br />
  He went around as in a trap.<br />
  He had a stick to feel and rap.<br />
  <i>A-rap-a-tap, a-rap-a-tap</i>.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I strode across the public square.<br />
  I stopped and spoke him full and fair.<br />
  I asked him what he searched for there.<br />
  There came a look upon his face<br />
  That made me want to leave the place.<br />
  He could not answer for a space.<br />
  He moved his trembling hands about<br />
  And in-and-out, and in-and-out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Kind sir," he said, "I scarcely know&mdash;<br />
  A week ago there fell a blow&mdash;<br />
  I think it was a week ago.<br />
  I sent my little girl to school,<br />
  With kisses and her book and rule,<br />
  A week ago she went to school."<br />
  The pigeons all began to coo,<br />
  "<i>A-cock-a-loo, a-cock-a-loo.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O God! to be a blinded fool;<br />
  I cannot find the children's school&mdash;<br />
  The gate, the court about the pool&mdash;<br />
  But, sir, if you will guide my feet<br />
  Across the square and down the street,<br />
  I think I know then where it lies.<br />
  <i>O Jesu!  Give me back my eyes!<br />
  O Jesu!  Give me back my eyes!</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I led him down the littered street,<br />
  He seemed to know it with his feet,<br />
  For suddenly he turned aside<br />
  And entered through a gateway wide.<br />
  It was the court about the pool.<br />
  Long shadows slept there deep and cool.<br />
  No sound was there of beast or bird;<br />
  It was the silence that we heard.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And this," he said, "might be the place,"<br />
  An eager look came on his face.<br />
  He raised his voice and gave a call;<br />
  An echo mewed along the wall,<br />
  And then it rose, and then it fell,<br />
  Like children talking down a well.<br />
  "Go in," he said, "see what you see,<br />
  And then come back again for me."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Like one who bears a weight of sin<br />
  And walks with fear, I entered in&mdash;<br />
  A turn&mdash;and halfway up the stair<br />
  There was a sight to raise your hair;<br />
  A dusty litter, books and toys,<br />
  Three bundles that were little boys,<br />
  White faces like an ivory gem;<br />
  A statue stood and looked at them.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So thick the silence where I stood,<br />
  I thought I wore a woolen hood;<br />
  The blood went whispering through my ears,<br />
  Like secrets that one overhears.<br />
  I looked upon the dead a while;<br />
  I saw the glimmering statue smile.<br />
  The children slept so sweetly there,<br />
  I scarce believed the tainted air.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And then I heard the blindman's stick,<br />
  As rhythmic as a watch's tick,<br />
  <i>A step&mdash;a click, a step&mdash;a click&mdash;</i><br />
  As slow as days grow to a year,<br />
  So long it seemed while he drew near,<br />
  But sure and blind as death or fate,<br />
  He came and said, "I dared not wait.<br />
  It was too silent at the gate."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And tell me now, sir, what you see<br />
  That keeps you here so silently."<br />
  "Three harmless things," I said, "I fear,<br />
  Three things I see but cannot hear,<br />
  Three shadows of what was before,<br />
  Cast by no light are on the floor."<br />
  "Sir," said the blindman, "lead me round,<br />
  Lest I should tread on holy ground."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Like men they lead at dawn to doom,<br />
  We slowly climbed the stairway's gloom<br />
  And came into a sunlit room.<br />
  The ceiling lay upon the floor,<br />
  And slates, and books, and something more&mdash;<br />
  The master with a glassy stare,<br />
  Sat gory in his shivered chair<br />
  And gazed upon his pupils there.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The blindman grasped me eagerly.<br />
  "And tell me now, sir, what you see?<br />
  This is the place where she should be&mdash;<br />
  My Eleanor, who used to wear<br />
  Short socks that left her brown legs bare.<br />
  She had a crown of golden hair."<br />
  I saw his blind eyes peer and stare.<br />
  <i>Now there and here, now here and there</i>.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Blindman," I cried, "these things I see:<br />
  Time here has turned eternity.<br />
  The clock hands point but only mock,<br />
  For it is always three o'clock.<br />
  I see the shadows on the wall;<br />
  I see the crumbling plaster fall."<br />
  "Oh! sir," he said, "I crave your eyes&mdash;<br />
  Be not so kindly with your lies."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I drew the blindman to my side;<br />
  I told the truth I wished to hide.<br />
  I said, "I see your Eleanor<br />
  And she is dead upon the floor.<br />
  And something fumbles with her hair;<br />
  I guess the wind is playing there.<br />
  And I see gray rats sleek and stout<br />
  That dart about and dart about."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Now, sir," he said, "I love your lies<br />
  And Christ be thanked that took my eyes!<br />
  But lead me, lead me to my dead!<br />
  And let me touch her once," he said.<br />
  I placed his hand upon her head.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And when we left the charnel place,<br />
  I dared not look upon his face;<br />
  For suddenly upon the street<br />
  Arose the sound of trampling feet,<br />
  And wheels that rumbled on the ground,<br />
  <i>And ground around and ground around</i>,<br />
  The din of them that go to slay,<br />
  The shout of men and horses' neigh,<br />

  A dreadful drumming on before.<br />

<p class="poem">
  I know a glade in Argonne where they lean&mdash;<br />
  Those crosses&mdash;loosened by last winter's snows,<br />
  Throwing their silent shadows on the green;<br />
  There I could go this very day&mdash;God knows!<br />
  To hide a sorrow mocked by tears and words,<br />
  To fall face downward on the catholic grass<br />
  That sprang this springtime through the shroud of snows<br />
  And let the little, greenwood birds say mass.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Like sound of taps at twilight from the hill,<br />
  The solemn thought comes that these lads are gone;<br />
  At evening when the breathing world grows still<br />
  And ghostly day steals from the bird-hushed lawn,<br />
  When over wooded crests the swimming moon<br />
  Casts ivory spells of beauty they have lost,<br />
  Across delicious valleys warm with June<br />
  I count the ghastly price the victory cost.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I count it in moongold and coin of life,<br />
  The love and beauty that these dead have missed,<br />
  Who lived to reap no glory from the strife,<br />
  But are like sleepers by the loved one kissed;<br />
  Each sleeps and knows not that she is so near,<br />
  Or at the most sinks deeper in his dream,<br />
  And life, and all blithe things they once held dear,<br />
  Are far and faint like voices of a stream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hands off our dead!  For all they did forbear<br />
  To drag them from their graves to point some speech;<br />
  Less sickening was the gas reek over there,<br />
  Less deadly was the shrapnel's whirring screech;<br />
  You cannot guess the uttermost they gave;<br />
  Those martyrs did not die for chattering daws<br />
  To loot false inspiration from the grave<br />
  When mouthing fools turn ghouls to gain applause.<br />

  I think at first like us he did not see<br />
  The goal to which the screaming eagles flew;<br />
  For romance lured him, France, and chivalry;<br />

  And gave his first full love to Liberty,<br />
  And met her face to face one lurid night<br />
  While the guns boomed their shuddering minstrelsy<br />
  And all the Argonne glowed with demon light.<br />
  And Liberty herself came through the wood,<br />
  And with her dear, boy lover kept the tryst;<br />
  Clasped in her grand, Greek arms he understood<br />
  Whose were the fatal lips that he had kissed&mdash;<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  Left to its fate, the little village stands<br />
  Between the armies trenched on either hill,<br />
  Raising twin spires like supplicating hands<br />
  From meadow lands where all lies ghastly still.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The lakes of clover ripple to the breeze<br />
  As from the vineyards glides a rancid breath,<br />
  Bringing the homelike murmur of the bees,<br />
  Mixed with a sickening whiff of carrion death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It is the valley of the shadow there,<br />
  Where death lies ambushed in the tossing flowers<br />
  Whose very beauty seems to cry, "<i>Beware!</i>"<br />
  For terror haunts its villages and towers.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That home where peasants led their blameless life,<br />
  That thatched, stone cottage is a clever trap<br />
  With painful wounds and fatal danger rife,<br />
  Noted with two red circles on the map.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Seen through the glass, dead, sleeps the <i>petite place</i>.<br />
  Where white-capped housewives lingered once to chat<br />
  On market days, or after early mass;<br />
  Now nothing moves there but the stealthy cat&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The only thing that even dares to stir;<br />
  It hugs short shadows near the walls at noon,<br />
  Lashing its tail to hear an airplane purr,<br />
  Circling about a peering, fat balloon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The houses gleam too bright, their limelight glare,<br />
  Pure sunlight though it be, is filled with gloom;<br />
  They are too white, too garnished and too bare&mdash;<br />
  They are too much like walls about a tomb.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The windows stare beside each gaping door,<br />
  Where once in gingham apron and a shawl,<br />
  In days now passed away forevermore,<br />
  Some little mother sat and nursed her doll.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sepulchral silence and a lonely dread<br />
  And desolation's calm have settled down,<br />
  Making brief peace there for the rigid dead&mdash;<br />

<p class="poem">
  How like high mountain air this air in France;<br />
  The sun is so intense, so clear, so bright,<br />
  The fields unearthly green, the poplars glance,<br />
  Shivering their leafy lances in the light.<br />
  Those drilling troops flash back a steely gleam.<br />
  Others with distant din of clean delight,<br />
  Bathe where their bodies flash along the stream<br />
  And everywhere, the air, a lake of light!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  White light, strange light of tense romantic days,<br />
  You are too rare, too cloudless and too clear,<br />

  BEAUMONT.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Deep in the mystery of the woodland's gloom,<br />
  Topping the sea of trees with pointed cone,<br />
  So that from many hills its towers loom,<br />
  The old château of Beaumont stands alone.<br />
  This generation saw its last sons go<br />
  To spill their noble blood with humbler men;<br />
  So Madame lives alone at the château<br />
  And waits for steps that never come again.<br />
  The sunlight sleeps along the buttressed walls,<br />
  And on the stagnant moats the midges dance,<br />
  And in the haunted wood the cuckoo calls,<br />
  Where hunted once the vanished kings of France.<br />
  The terraced gardens hum with greedy bees,<br />
  And Madame walks among the orange trees.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Boxed orange shrubs&mdash;they stand in potted row<br />
  Along the plaisance&mdash;Madame takes her ease;<br />
  But it is lonely at the old château;<br />
  The milky statues glimmer through the trees,<br />
  So silent, too!  What can make Madame start?<br />
  Down in the garden where late roses blow,<br />
  She has heard laughter there that stopt her heart<br />
  Like echoes from old summers long ago.<br />
  But no&mdash;it cannot be!  For hark! the click<br />
  Of little peasants' sabots; down the walk<br />
  That winds among the rows of hedges thick,<br />
  The children's voices die away in talk.<br />
  Alas!  Who knows, who knows,<br />
  Why Madame bends so long above the rose?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Gently, old heart&mdash;there is no recompense<br />
  For the last uttermost you had to give.<br />
  Yet there is peace for you to outward sense&mdash;<br />
  God gives you Beaumont as a place to live.<br />
  The white herds graze in stately indolence,<br />
  While you sit knitting on the terrace there,<br />
  And that your hands still feel no impotence,<br />
  Witness the poor and <i>Croix Rouge</i> at St. Pierre;<br />
  And sweet the drive home through the wooded park,<br />
  When faintly chime the far-off steeple clocks<br />
  At dusk when village dogs begin to bark,<br />
  And the long lanes go glimmering white with flocks,<br />
  When the first, steely stars begin to peep<br />
  And the young shepherd whistles to his sheep.<br />

  Here in this garden where the roses bloom,<br />
  And time is scarcely marked by silent days,<br />
  The walls and pear trees cast a pleasant gloom,<br />
  A wavy, weed-grown fountain softly plays.<br />
  And fate has left us listless for a while<br />
  Upon the brink of what we do not know;<br />
  Outside the walls a passing schoolboy calls,<br />
  And lumbering oxcarts rumble as they go.<br />

  Red roofs, a spire, white roads and poplar trees;<br />
  An aeroplane goes droning through the skies;<br />
  The petals fall, there is no breath of breeze;<br />
  The old dog by the sundial snaps at flies.<br />
  My comrades by the fountain are asleep.<br />
  Far on the lines I hear a great gun boom;<br />
  Here in the garden, though, white peace lies deep,<br />

  The <i>flammenwerfer</i> with their dragon's breath<br />
  Compressed in nippled bottle-tanks of death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They puffed along the wall and one long cry<br />
  Withered away into the morning sky,<br />
  And some made crablike gestures where they lay<br />
  And all our faces turned oil gray,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Now when the crumpets lie with blusterous joy<br />
  And the silk, wind-tweaked colors virgin fresh,<br />
  Borne by the blithe, boy bodies glitter past,<br />

  The dragon's breath leaps from the bugle blast<br />

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
